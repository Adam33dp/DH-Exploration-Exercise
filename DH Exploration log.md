+ First I had to choose what I wanted my exercise to be about and since my major is in history and my minor in geography I would like to pick something that will spark my interest. I chose to pick immigrants coming from European countries to North America before 1865.
+ When I went to the government website and imported the data to an excel file and discovered that there was way too much of it and I needed to narrow it down to complete this exercise.
+ So I went down to 5 years and than again to just the one year 1865 alone, this gave me about three hundred people from five different countries.
+ There was also a lot of unnecessary data such as the gender of the people, which boat they came on and how many kids there were. When I tried to create a graph for this data it became way to confusing especially for such a simple amount of data. All I wanted was to know how  many people came to Canada, where they went specifically and where they came from.
+  So I narrowed it down again to just the amount of people no matter the gender or the age if they were kids or adults, which country they came from and where in Canada or the United States they landed.
+ This seemed to me like the proper amount of data for what I was trying to accomplish, so after fixing up my excel sheet and creating the graph it was now time to input that into GitHub.
+ Of course I ran into a problem with that, which Professor Graham was able to help me with, apparently GitHub does not like Excel so it would not directly take the conversion into my repo.
+ I took a screenshot instead of my graph and my data and inserted that into my repo instead which worked fine, that is enough for today.

+ With my information now in front of me I had to decide on how to move forward with my exercise and think how else can I display this information.
+ The two tutorials that spoke to me where the one on Storymaps and the one about maps from spreadsheets. These two in particular would fit nicely into my exercise, especially because they both deal with Geography and I can display where people came from through these sites.
+ I decided to start with maps from spreadsheets first and plot all the places on the map of where people came from and where they immigrated to.
+ Which people from each country went to which part of North America this way you could visualize their trip during 1865 and see where in Europe they all came from.
+ This program was relatively easy to work with I did not seem to run into any problems, now to move on to the Storymaps application.
+ This will take some research as to why people decided to leave their home country and move across the Atlantic to North America, I will put this down for now and do some research on these countries during 1865.

+ After spending a few hours looking into these countries in 1865 I was able to see why some of them decided to relocate so I can now plug it all into Storymaps
+ This was a rather fun tutorial so I am looking forward to doing this and creating my own exercise with this program
+ I  found pictures of each country and put about a paragraph of information into each slide detailing why the immigrants decided to leave and come to North America
+ There was not a lot of information on Switzerland as there were not that many immigrants at the time but I think I should be fine on the information I provided
+ When I was trying to put in the coordinates for each country I found it difficult and creating something I did not want
+ But when I searched up the actual coordinates of the country that seemed to work better
+ After finishing up the Storymaps it was now time to put it all together and finish up my DH Exploration exercise

+ Now just having trouble getting all my pictures and websites on the Github websites
+ I can get them to work on Github but for some reason not on the website I tried putting them in Brackets both round and square like in the markdown cheat sheet but I'm thinking that it has something to do with the website and not the coding. I wil reach out to Professor Graham and see what he says.
+ I went back to some of the readings from the first week to see when and where people started digitizing archives, which was very interesting

**_17-06-2022_**

+ After getting my Storymap set up and my google map set up, I now just need to organize everything neatly on my Repo, I have been trying to create a website with working links and pictures but have been failing
+ I tried having the picture in the same repo, I tried j=having the picture in a separate repo, I played around with the link and cannot find a solution.
+ I have been working this week so have only been able to reach out to Professor Graham at night which he has given me a few suggestions but none have worked so far.
+ So I might have to wrap up my exercise without fully completing it, not fully polished but I did what I could and I certainly feel like I learned a lot from this class not only about digital history but also about my own digital footprint.
